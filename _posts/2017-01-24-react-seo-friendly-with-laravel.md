When developing SPA (Single Page Application), the most headache thing is SEO and blank page (waiting spinner) when page first loaded.

SEO in SPA is tricky with many methods. Sometime we think about switching to NodeJs with Isomorphic (Same code base share between client and server with server rendering JS).

But if you not familiar with NodeJs or be in loved with some other Programing languages and don't want to move. It's realy a pain.
